### [Sentiment Analysis with Keras in Azure Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7SdNB2-_Ao&list=PLmlyXr9DRjskd3heUO_xJ8cmQ-7FwwyaA&index=4)
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python, that runs on top of other deep learning tools such as TensorFlow. This module uses Keras in conjunction Jupyter Notebooks in Azure Notebooks to build a neural network that scores text, such as user reviews for sentiment.
